<p>I try to avoid setting styles in my code as much as possible. However, I ran across a case using a DevExpress PageControl control where there was no possible way to set a certain border by using CSS. This is because DevExpress wisely (read sarcasm) uses “border-color: #whatever !important” in the element’s style attribute. So, there is no way to override that style except by setting it on the control in code (or your aspx page).</p>

<p>The particular border I needed is the ContentStyle.Border border of the ASPxPageControl and I needed to set the BorderColor property which is a System.Drawing.Color object. There isn’t any straightforward way to get a Color object from a hexadecimal color using the Color object itself. You have to use the ColorTranslator (also in the System.Drawing namespace) which gives you a FromHtml method and returns the correct Color object.</p>
