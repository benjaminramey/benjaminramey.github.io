{"pageProps":{"tags":["sitecore"],"categories":["programming"],"title":"Sitecore Rocks and SharePoint Package Interference","contentHtml":"<p>I ran into an interesting problem today while working in Visual Studio 2010 on a SharePoint 2010 project.</p>\n<p>You are supposed to be able to open the Package.package files to edit the Features that are included and their order, etc. However, when I double-clicked on the Package.package file to open it, I got a strange dialog box that said the document was already open, would I like to close it? If I said “yes”, another “Package Connection” dialog box would open with all the IIS sites I had setup listed. However, none of my SharePoint sites were listed and choosing any of the other sites just failed.</p>\n<p>I have no idea why, honestly, but apparently Sitecore Rocks is causing this issue. I had the Visual Studio extension enabled (I had worked on a Sitecore project a few months ago). When I disabled it and restarted Visual Studio, everything worked as I expected when opening Package files.</p>\n","date":"2013-05-08T06:00:00Z","slug":"/2013/05/08/sitecore-rocks-and-sharepoint-package-interference"},"__N_SSG":true}
