I added it in the right location, restarted\nthe RabbitMQ Windows service and the logs still showed that the configuration file was not found.</p>\n<p>If you're experiencing the same problem, you'll see a similar error message in the RabbitMQ log file after\nyou restart the Windows service.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"highlight-text\"><code class=\"highlight-text\">=INFO REPORT==== &lt;date here&gt;\nnode\t\t\t: rabbit@&lt;server&gt;\nhome dir\t\t: C:\\Windows\nconfig file(s)\t: c:/path/to/config/rabbitmq.config (not found)\n...some other stuff...</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will happen if you just install your RabbitMQ server with the normal, default installation process\nand then try to add a configuration file later.  By default, RabbitMQ doesn't install configuration file and just\nuses all it's defined defaults.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>I read the <a href=\"http://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html\">documentation</a> a little more closely\nand finally came upon this line: \"Windows service users will need to re-install the service after adding\nor removing a configuration file.\"</p>\n<p>Oops.  Guess I should have read the documentation more closely the first time around!  The easiest way to\ndo this is as follows (start a command prompt as administrator):</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"highlight-text\"><code class=\"highlight-text\">&gt; cd &quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\RabbitMQ Server\\rabbitmq_server-3.6.0\\sbin&quot;\n&gt; .\\rabbitmq-service.bat remove\n&gt; .\\rabbitmq-service.bat install\n&gt; .\\rabbitmq-service.bat start</code></pre></div>\n<p>Of course, The path you cd into will depend on the version of RabbitMQ you have installed.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2016/01/04/adding-a-rabbitmq-configuration-file-when-running-as-a-windows-service/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Adding a RabbitMQ Configuration File When Running as a Windows Service","formattedDate":"Mon Jan 4th 2016","isoDate":"2016-01-04T15:26:00.000Z","fromNowDate":"5 years ago","categories":["programming"],"tags":["rabbitmq"]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Ben Ramey's Blog","tagline":"Scripture, programming problems, solutions and stories."}},"sitePage":{"path":"/dev-404-page/"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2016/01/04/adding-a-rabbitmq-configuration-file-when-running-as-a-windows-service/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
