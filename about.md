I have two purposes for this blog:
1. I learn something from someone else's blog online almost every day
doing my job.  I feel like it's only fair if I share the things I learn
on my own with whoever can find it.  If I save you some time by writing
down answers I had to dig up, then I will feel very gratified!

1. A lot of what I try to write down here is stuff I don't touch very often
in my day-to-day coding work.  I forget it easily.  So, this blog acts
as a sort of scratch pad for me write stuff down to refer to later.
