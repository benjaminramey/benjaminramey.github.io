<p>Determining the service pack that you have installed for a particular
SharePoint 2007 installation turned out to be a surprisingly opaque process.
I found this very clear and helpful blog post dealing with just this
determination:

<p>To give a quick overview, the right way to determine the installed service pack is to look up the version of SharePoint that you have installed and match it against a table (available at the link above) of version numbers to service packs.</p>

<p>Determine your SharePoint version by logging into your Central Administration site and going to Operations &gt; Servers In Farm &gt; Database Schema Version. Your SharePoint version will be listed in the table of servers in the farm.</p>

<p>Note that the link above only has version numbers listed through SP1 (the post is from October 2008). Use this link to get a more up-to-date listing of version numbers:
