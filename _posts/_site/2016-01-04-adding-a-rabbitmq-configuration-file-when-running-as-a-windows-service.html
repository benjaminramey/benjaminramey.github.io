<h2 id="a-little-context">A little context</h2>
<p>I was having a hard time adding a rabbitmq.config file today.  I added it in the right location, restarted
the RabbitMQ Windows service and the logs still showed that the configuration file was not found.</p>

<p>If you’re experiencing the same problem, you’ll see a similar error message in the RabbitMQ log file after
you restart the Windows service.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">=INFO REPORT==== &lt;date here&gt;
node			: rabbit@&lt;server&gt;
home dir		: C:\Windows
config file(s)	: c:/path/to/config/rabbitmq.config (not found)
...some other stuff...</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will happen if you just install your RabbitMQ server with the normal, default installation process
and then try to add a configuration file later.  By default, RabbitMQ doesn’t install configuration file and just
uses all it’s defined defaults.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>I read the <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html">documentation</a> a little more closely
and finally came upon this line: “Windows service users will need to re-install the service after adding
or removing a configuration file.”</p>

<p>Oops.  Guess I should have read the documentation more closely the first time around!  The easiest way to 
do this is as follows (start a command prompt as administrator):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-3.6.0\sbin"
&gt; .\rabbitmq-service.bat remove
&gt; .\rabbitmq-service.bat install
&gt; .\rabbitmq-service.bat start
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, The path you cd into will depend on the version of RabbitMQ you have installed.</p>
