<p>I recently ran across a need to generate all permutations of an array of objects
in some unit testing I was doing.</p>

<p>The specific situation was testing that, no matter what the order, when certain messages
were picked up by an <a href="http://particular.net/">NServiceBus</a> <a href="particular.net/articles/sagas-in-nservicebus">Saga</a>, that a certain state was consistent after all
messages were received.  Since I explicitly wanted to test the state no matter what order
the messages arrived in, I needed all permutations of those messages so I could send
them to the Saga in each order and test the resulting state.</p>

<p>I found this super article on the subject that gave all the code I needed: <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/09/16/permuterate">Generating Permutations with C# Iterators</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks IanG on Tap!</p>
