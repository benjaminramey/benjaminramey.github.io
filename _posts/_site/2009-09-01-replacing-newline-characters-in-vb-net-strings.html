<p>I’m not very familiar (which I am actually very happy for!) with VB.NET and so I had a hard time figuring out how to trim newline characters from a string in a Reporting Services report I was working on.</p>

<p>Turns out none of the “regular” methods really work.  The Trim function only removes spaces and anything like Replace(“string”, “\n”, “”) didn’t work.</p>

<p>You have to use the Chr(13) or Chr(10) functions to actually get the character values for the newline characters.  So, my solution looked like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="nf">Replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">Replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stringVariable</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nf">Chr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">10</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="err">“”</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nf">Chr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">13</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="err">“”</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Thanks to this forum post for providing the clues:
