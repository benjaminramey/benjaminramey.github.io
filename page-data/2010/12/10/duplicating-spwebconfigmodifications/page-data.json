Since the actual Value property of the SPWebConfigModification had quotes around the attribute value, whenever the SPWebConfigModification was applied, it could not find the existing element and therefore would add a second, duplicate element.</p>\n<p>In other words, this is wrong for the SPWebConfigModification Name: “add[@name=valueOfAttribute]“.</p>\n<p>This is correct: “add[@name=’valueOfAttribute’]“</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/12/10/duplicating-spwebconfigmodifications/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Duplicating SPWebConfigModifications","formattedDate":"Fri Dec 10th 2010","isoDate":"2010-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","fromNowDate":"10 years ago","categories":["programming"],"tags":["sharepoint"]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Ben Ramey's Blog","tagline":"Scripture, programming problems, solutions and stories."}},"sitePage":{"path":"/dev-404-page/"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/12/10/duplicating-spwebconfigmodifications/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
