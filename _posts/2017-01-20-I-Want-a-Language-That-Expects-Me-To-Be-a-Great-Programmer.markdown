A co-worker of mine recently turned me on to Uncle Bob's blog.  Yup, that's Uncle Bob Martin.

Here's one of his latest posts that sparked a thought in me: [The Dark Path](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/01/11/TheDarkPath.html).

When I got done reading the post, this was my simple thought: I want a programming language
that expects me to be a great programmer.
