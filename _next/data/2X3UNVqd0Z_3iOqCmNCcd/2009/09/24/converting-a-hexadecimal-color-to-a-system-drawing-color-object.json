However, I ran across a case using a DevExpress PageControl control where there was no possible way to set a certain border by using CSS. This is because DevExpress wisely (read sarcasm) uses “border-color: #whatever !important” in the element’s style attribute. So, there is no way to override that style except by setting it on the control in code (or your aspx page).</p>\n<p>The particular border I needed is the ContentStyle.Border border of the ASPxPageControl and I needed to set the BorderColor property which is a System.Drawing.Color object. There isn’t any straightforward way to get a Color object from a hexadecimal color using the Color object itself. You have to use the ColorTranslator (also in the System.Drawing namespace) which gives you a FromHtml method and returns the correct Color object.</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-csharp\"><code class=\"language-csharp\"><span class=\"token class-name\">Color</span> hexColor <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> ColorTranslator<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">FromHtml</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>“#<span class=\"token number\">666666</span>″<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Thanks to this guy for the quick answer:\n<a href=\"http://www.akxl.net/labs/articles/converting-a-hexadecimal-color-to-a-system.drawing.color-object/\">http://www.akxl.net/labs/articles/converting-a-hexadecimal-color-to-a-system.drawing.color-object/</a></p>\n","date":"2009-09-24T06:00:00Z","slug":"/2009/09/24/converting-a-hexadecimal-color-to-a-system-drawing-color-object"},"__N_SSG":true}
