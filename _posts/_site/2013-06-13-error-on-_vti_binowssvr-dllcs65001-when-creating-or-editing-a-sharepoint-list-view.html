  <p>UPDATE (6/14/2013):
After some further issues I encountered (unrelated to the OWSSVR.dll error, but on this module) I found out that the problem is with accessing query string parameters (at least). However, accessing the HttpRequest object’s Url property, for example, doesn’t cause this error.</p>

  <p>So, I moved my code back to the BeginRequest event (to solve my other problem) and then I just did a simple HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.AbsoluteUri.Contains(“owssvr”) check to go on and check the query string parameters or not.</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>I was recently very frustrated by the dreaded “Cannot complete this action” error on a SharePoint 2010 project when trying to edit or create a new view for any list.  I looked around and found several causes that others had pinpointed, but nothing really related to the specific situation I was seeing.  I wasn’t seeing this on a particular list or set of lists.  I could create an out-of-the-box SharePoint Document Library and get this error when trying to edit or create a view.</p>

<p>What finally got me on the right track was this link here that a co-worker of mine found:</p>

<p><a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sharepointdevelopmentprevious/thread/ea0b1380-480f-4b2e-afde-77ed06995bb0">MSDN forum thread</a></p>

<p>In a response to the question in that thread, it is mentioned that accessing the SPContext static object in an HttpModule causes this error when the /_vti_bin/owssvr.dll is accessed.  Great!  There was only one problem for me: my HttpModule was not accessing the SPContext object anywhere. Nevertheless, when I removed my HttpModules from the web.config, the list editing and creation worked.  So, it was definitely something with my modules.</p>

<p>Still, the post mentioned above got me on the right track.  By commenting out code a bit at a time, I narrowed the problem down to a check for the HttpContext.Current.Request object that I was performing.  This is probably the same error that is caused by the SPContext object, since, as I understand it, the SPContext object just wraps the HttpContext object.</p>

<p>I had the following code in my HttpModule.  Here is what Init method looked like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">HttpApplication</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">BeginRequest</span> <span class="p">+=</span> <span class="n">SetupOutputFilter</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">PreSendRequestHeaders</span> <span class="p">+=</span> <span class="n">WritePdfHeaders</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">PreSendRequestContent</span> <span class="p">+=</span> <span class="n">WritePdfToOutput</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Commenting out the tie into the BeginRequest event fixed the issue, so it had to be something there. SetupOutputFilter looked like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">SetupOutputFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">object</span> <span class="n">sender</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">EventArgs</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(!</span><span class="n">IsPdfRequest</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="n">HttpResponse</span> <span class="n">response</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">HttpContext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Response</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">_pdfStream</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">PdfMemoryStream</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Filter</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Filter</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">_pdfStream</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Commenting out the if expression also fixed the issue. My IsPdfRequest property looked like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">IsPdfRequest</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">get</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">!</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">IsNullOrEmpty</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">HttpContext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Request</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"as"</span><span class="p">])</span>
          <span class="p">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">HttpContext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Request</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"as"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="s">"pdf"</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And there you have my access to the HttpContext object. I kind of needed this though, so I thought it might be a timing issue. Maybe accessing this on BeginRequest was the problem. I took a look at the ordering of the HttpModule events to find a good replacement. This StackOverflow thread helped me there:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/441421/httpmodule-event-execution-order">StackOverflow thread</a></p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>By switching my SetOutputFilter method from the BeginRequest event to the PostReleaseRequestState event, I was able to fix the issue.</p>

<p>So, the lesson here is this: if you need HttpModules for your SharePoint 2010 project, make sure they do not access the HttpContext object anywhere in the BeginRequest event.</p>
