<p>I was getting a “Specified method is not supported” error when I tried to delete some test sites in SharePoint 2010 today. I found a great link that gave several solutions to deletion errors. Issue #1 under this link is what I needed:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.benramey.com/2012/09/25/specified-method-is-not-supported-error-when-deleting-sharepoint-site/#">SharePoint 2010: Unable to delete site/web after SP1</a></p>

<p>Even though I got an error executing the Upgrade-SPContentDatabase PowerShell command, it still fixed the problem with deleting the sites.</p>
