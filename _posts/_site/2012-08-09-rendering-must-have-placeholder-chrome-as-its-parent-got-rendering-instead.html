<p>##Problem
I got the error message (in my Firebug console) in the Sitecore Page Editor on a page where I had a nested sublayout.  I had a basic two-column layout for the main sublayout of the page.  Then, in the right column, I had another sublayout that further divided up the right column as I needed.  Here is what the nested sublayout looked like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;sc:Placeholder</span> <span class="na">runat=</span><span class="s">"server"</span> <span class="na">Key=</span><span class="s">"blogRightColumnTop"</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"sidebar-blog"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;sc:Placeholder</span> <span class="na">runat=</span><span class="s">"server"</span> <span class="na">Key=</span><span class="s">"blogRightColumnBottomLeft"</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"sidebar-ads"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;sc:Placeholder</span> <span class="na">runat=</span><span class="s">"server"</span> <span class="na">Key=</span><span class="s">"blogRightColumnBottomRight"</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This was a Javascript error that was preventing the Page Editor from fully loading the editor buttons for the edit frames I had on the page.</p>

<p>##Solution
The error message (surprise, surprise) was a little mystifying, but it gave me enough of a clue to think that there was some type of nesting issue.  I noticed that I had a sc:Placeholder element at the top of my nested sub-layout with nothing wrapping it.  Perhaps this was the issue?  I tried this edit to my nested sub-layout:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;sc:Placeholder</span> <span class="na">runat=</span><span class="s">"server"</span> <span class="na">Key=</span><span class="s">"blogRightColumnTop"</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"sidebar-blog"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;sc:Placeholder</span> <span class="na">runat=</span><span class="s">"server"</span> <span class="na">Key=</span><span class="s">"blogRightColumnBottomLeft"</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"sidebar-ads"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;sc:Placeholder</span> <span class="na">runat=</span><span class="s">"server"</span> <span class="na">Key=</span><span class="s">"blogRightColumnBottomRight"</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice the single, wrapping div. This worked! So, Iâ€™m not sure why, but apparently it solves this nesting problem. Perhaps Sitecore just does not expect a sc:Placeholder to be directly inside of another sc:Placeholder and so wrapping it solves that direct nesting issue.</p>
