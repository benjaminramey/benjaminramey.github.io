Since I explicitly wanted to test the state no matter what order\nthe messages arrived in, I needed all permutations of those messages so I could send\nthem to the Saga in each order and test the resulting state.</p>\n<p>I found this super article on the subject that gave all the code I needed: <a href=\"http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/09/16/permuterate\">Generating Permutations with C# Iterators</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks IanG on Tap!</p>\n","date":"2015-09-03T00:00:00Z","slug":"/2015/09/permutations-with-iterators-in-csharp"},"__N_SSG":true}
