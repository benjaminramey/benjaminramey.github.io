If you try to do a SharePoint 2010 installation on your client machine (that is, not a Windows Server OS) then you’ll get an error explaining that SharePoint 2010 can’t be installed on your operating system.

Never fear, CodeProject is here. Check out this helpful post to get it installed (it couldn’t be easier):

[CodeProject article](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/44210/Installing-SharePoint-Server-2010-on-Windows-7-x64)

Even though the post is from 2009, it still works great.

For more detailed steps (including the ones outlined in the link above) following these instructions:

They will help you get the prerequisites installed as well.
