The purpose of this blog is for me share the things I'm learning on the job.
I also post things I want to remember.  I constantly run into problems
that I know I've solved before, but they just come up too infrequently to
really remember exactly how I fixed them last time.  So, writing about it 
gives me a nice little log of problems I've solved and helps me to remember
them.

If you find anything useful here, my hopes and dreams will truly be made
complete!
