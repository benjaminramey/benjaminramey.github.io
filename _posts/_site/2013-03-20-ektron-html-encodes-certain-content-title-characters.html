<p>I found out today, while trying to search for certain content items in Ektron, that Ektron HTML encodes certain characters in content titles–but does not, apparently, HTML encode the entire title.</p>

<p>Here is a list of characters I’ve found so far that Ektron encodes in the title:</p>

<ul>
  <li>/ (forward slash)</li>
  <li>‘ (apostrophe – single quote)</li>
  <li>&amp; (ampersand)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is what I know they do NOT encode in titles:</p>

<p>® (registered trademark symbol)</p>

<p>So, if you need to perform a search for Ektron content with a title like “Miner’s Hat”, then you need to encode it as “Miner's Hat” to find it.</p>
