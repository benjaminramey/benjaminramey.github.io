If I said “yes”, another “Package Connection” dialog box would open with all the IIS sites I had setup listed.  However, none of my SharePoint sites were listed and choosing any of the other sites just failed.</p>\n<p>I have no idea why, honestly, but apparently Sitecore Rocks is causing this issue.  I had the Visual Studio extension enabled (I had worked on a Sitecore project a few months ago).  When I disabled it and restarted Visual Studio, everything worked as I expected when opening Package files.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/05/08/sitecore-rocks-and-sharepoint-package-interference/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sitecore Rocks and SharePoint Package Interference","formattedDate":"Wed May 8th 2013","isoDate":"2013-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","fromNowDate":"8 years ago","categories":["programming"],"tags":["sitecore"]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Ben Ramey's Blog","tagline":"Scripture, programming problems, solutions and stories."}},"sitePage":{"path":"/dev-404-page/"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2013/05/08/sitecore-rocks-and-sharepoint-package-interference/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
