Since the actual Value property of the SPWebConfigModification had quotes around the attribute value, whenever the SPWebConfigModification was applied, it could not find the existing element and therefore would add a second, duplicate element.</p>\n<p>In other words, this is wrong for the SPWebConfigModification Name: “add[@name=valueOfAttribute]“.</p>\n<p>This is correct: “add[@name=’valueOfAttribute’]“</p>\n","date":"2010-12-10T06:00:00Z","slug":"/2010/12/10/duplicating-spwebconfigmodifications"},"__N_SSG":true}
